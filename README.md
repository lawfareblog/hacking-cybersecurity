**Instructors:** [Scott J. Shapiro](https://law.yale.edu/scott-j-shapiro) &amp; [Sean O'Brien](https://cyberclear.cc)
<!-- **Guest Instructor:** [Laurin Weissinger](https://laurinw.com), Week 8: Networking III -->

## Welcome Future Hackers!

We are delighted to announce a first on [Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-hacking-and-cybersecurity-course): A live online class on hacking and cybersecurity.

The live course will be open to Lawfare's [material supporters](https://www.patreon.com/lawfare), and we will edit and post each recorded class session as videos that will amount to a public course on computer hacking.

Whether one joins live or watches the videos later, students will learn to use virtual machines to "hack" other virtual machines using standard attacks such as packet sniffing, buffer overflow, IP spoofing, certification forgery, Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM or MiTM), SQL injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

## TLDR;
Drop into the class and be ready with this Command Line Interface (CLI): 

* [OPEN COMMAND LINE INTERFACE IN BROWSER](https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192)

Though we will be using Kali Linux this CLI will get you started and following along at the start of the class. After the second week, when we move to more complex concepts and examples, this CLI will no longer be useful.

## Getting Started

To prepare for the course, students must download: 

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) virtualization software that will run a "virtual machine" operating system
2. Virtual machine (VM) versions of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines), an operating system specifically designed for hacking and penetration testing.

We require students to run virtual machines to avoid problems on their own operating systems - in this way, they are running a special "OS within an OS" that won't mess with their Mac or Windows environment.

**NOTE:** More adventurous or experienced users may [install Kali Linux directly](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) on their hardware without virtualization or can try virtualization software such as [VMware](https://www.VMware.com), which may be a better option for your unique situation. However, the instructors and our support staff will not be able to help troubleshoot or guide users choosing these alternative options. As hackers say, [YMMV](https://www.howtogeek.com/693183/what-does-ymmv-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/).

### System Requirements

To effectively run virtual machines inside your host operating system, we recommend these minimum hardware specifications: 

* 4 GB of RAM
* 32 GB of disk space
* 64-bit CPU (multiple core) with 2 GHz speed or better
	- See [note about the latest Mac M1/M2 models](#Mac-M1M2-Users) below.
* High definition graphics card
* Broadband Internet connection
* Latest versions of Windows, macOS, or GNU/Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS recommended)

**A good rule of thumb:** Use a computer no older than the start of the Covid pandemic. We will try to accommodate students who do not have these minimum specs available, such as users with 32-bit machines. See [note about the latest Mac M1/M2 models](#Mac-M1M2-Users) below.

#### Mac M1/M2 Users

The latest Apple Mac models use a custom M1 or M2 ARM chipset, known as Apple Silicon, that is **not an Intel or AMD** architecture (commonly referred to on the websites we link as "64-bit" or "x64").

This is a relatively new development, and virtualization on these Mac M1/M2 machines can be tricky. On these systems, the best solution seems to be [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/), with [VMware Fusion](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-VMware-silicon-host/) as an alternate option.

* [Download Parallels for Mac M1/M2 models](https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/)
	- [Install Kali Linux on Mac M1/M2 using Parallels](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-parallels-guest-vm/)
	- [Video 1: Install Kali on Parallels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fchK2XMzou8)
	- [Video 2: Install Kali on Parallels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHlZEU5ejek)

* [Download VMware Fusion for Mac M1/M2 models](https://customerconnect.VMware.com/downloads/get-download?downloadGroup=FUS-PUBTP-22H2)
	- [Install Kali Linux on Mac M1/M2 using VMware Fusion](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-silicon-host/)

	- [Video 1: Install Kali on VMware Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qhL1Blq8es)
	- [Video 2: Install Kali on VMware Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMd5PrdwiOM)

* [Install Kali on Mac M1/M2 using UTM](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-utm-guest-vm/)
	- [Video: Install Kali on Mac M1/M2 using UTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2e-fRLxXnU)

### Download &amp; Install VirtualBox

[CLICK HERE](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and download the VirtualBox installer for your operating system. You may also need to install the Extension Pack on your operating system, depending on settings.

[<img src="week01/images/virtualbox-download.png" width="600" />](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

VirtualBox installation tutorials: 

* [Video for Windows users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mns5yqMfZk)
* [Video for Mac users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd0Lbtly41Y)
* GNU/Linux users: [Ubuntu](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-on-ubuntu-20-04/) | [Debian](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-on-debian-10/) | [CentOS](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-virtualbox-on-centos-8/)

### Download &amp; Install Kali Linux

[CLICK HERE](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) and download a 64-bit pre-built virtual machine (VM) image of Kali Linux. You will add this VM image to VirtualBox to boot into Kali Linux inside your host operating system.

[<img src="week01/images/kali-download.png" width="600" />](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)

Kali Linux setup tutorials: 

* [Video for Windows users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKLa8UkRYTY)
* [Video for Mac users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2nzRtDVknk)
* [Video for GNU/Linux users](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILwRmXx8kwg)

#### Extracting the 7-Zip Files

[Kali Linux VMs](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) are distributed in a compressed 7-Zip .7z format.  If your OS does not have software to extract 7-Zip files, please try installing one of these options: 

* [PeaZIP](https://peazip.github.io/)
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
* [IZArc](https://www.izarc.org/downloads)

#### Log In to Kali Linux

You may have to [restart your system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85xwZ_OLX0) to make sure virtualization drivers are loaded by your OS. Once you can boot Kali Linux, please log in. If you have installed Kali via the [VirtualBox VM method we recommend](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines), the default credentials are: 

* username: `kali`
* password: `kali`

<img src="week01/images/kali-login.png" width="600" />

Don't worry, we'll show you how to change this default password (and crack the weak passwords of other users)!
