## Recording Your Hacks

To record your hacks, it's best to use the software you're familiar with. If you are running Kali Linux in a Virtual Machine window, each of these programs will allow you to capture either your whole screen or just that virtual machine window and also narrate with audio.

### Zoom

To record a video in Zoom, you can create your own personal meeting with just you attending. Then, you can share screen and record the video locally.
