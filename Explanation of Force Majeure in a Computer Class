Subject: Explanation of Force Majeure in a Computer Class

Dear Professor Shapiro,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you in regards to the final project for the computer class. I wanted to discuss the concept of force majeure and how it applies to the context of a computer class, much like in the days of sail.

As you may know, force majeure refers to unforeseeable and uncontrollable circumstances, such as acts of nature, which prevent an individual from fulfilling their obligations. In the context of a computer class, this could refer to technical issues or hardware failures that are beyond the control of the student.

Just like how a ship in the days of sail could be blown off course by unpredictable weather conditions, a student's final project for a computer class could be delayed or impacted by factors such as power outages, software crashes, or other unexpected events.

I also wanted to discuss the Originalist's case for mystery in computer hardware, which can contribute to the unpredictability of technology and make it difficult for students to complete their projects on time. On the other hand, the positivist's case for GUI can be compared to the sea itself, as both have a certain level of stability and structure, yet are subject to change and unpredictability.

I hope this email has provided some clarification on the concept of force majeure in a computer class and how it can impact students. I would be happy to discuss this further in person or via email.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
